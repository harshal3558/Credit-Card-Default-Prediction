## End to End Credit Card Default Prediction

Steps for Implementation

* Data Exploration & Cleaning

Load raw.csv and explore the dataset.
Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Perform data visualization to understand patterns.

* Feature Engineering

    1. Encode categorical variables.
    2. Normalize/scale numerical variables if required.
    3. Feature selection and transformation.

* Model Building

    1. Split data into training and testing sets.
    2. Try different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
    3. Optimize hyperparameters for the best performance.

* Model Evaluation

    1. Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.
    2. Compare model performances.

* Deployment & API

    1. Convert the trained model into an API or web interface.
    2. Deploy on a cloud service like AWS/GCP/Azure.

* Documentation & Submission

    1. Create a README, HLD, LLD, and system architecture.
    2.  Submit code on GitHub with proper documentation.



# Logistic Regression Performance

* Accuracy: 80.8%
* Precision: 68.7%
* Recall: 24.3%
* AUC-ROC: 60.6%

Observations

* The model has good accuracy but low recall, meaning it struggles to identify defaults.
* Precision is decent, meaning when it predicts a default, it's likely correct.
* AUC-ROC of 60.6% suggests we can improve the model.


# Random Forest Performance

* Accuracy: 81.4%
* Precision: 64.1%
* Recall: 35.9% (better than Logistic Regression)
* AUC-ROC: 65.1% (better than Logistic Regression)

Observations

* Improved recall compared to Logistic Regression (24.3% â†’ 35.9%).
* AUC-ROC increased, indicating better overall performance.
* Still room for improvement, possibly with XGBoost.


# XGBoost Performance

* Accuracy: 81.5%
* Precision: 65.5%
* Recall: 37.1% (highest so far)
* AUC-ROC: 65.8% (best so far)

Observations

* XGBoost outperforms both Logistic Regression and Random Forest in recall and AUC-ROC.
* Higher recall means it catches more defaults, which is crucial in financial risk assessment.
* Best overall performance, making it the preferred model for this task.


Next Steps

# Deep Learning Implementation Plan

1. Data Preprocessing
Drop ID column (not useful).
Fix categorical variables (EDUCATION, MARRIAGE).
Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler.
Split data into train (80%) and test (20%) sets.

2. Build Neural Network Model
Input layer: 23 features.
2-3 hidden layers with ReLU activation.
Dropout layers for regularization.
Output layer: Sigmoid activation (binary classification).

3. Training & Evaluation
Loss function: Binary Crossentropy.
Optimizer: Adam.
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC.
Train for 50-100 epochs.

4. Compare Results with XGBoost
Check accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Determine which model performs better.
